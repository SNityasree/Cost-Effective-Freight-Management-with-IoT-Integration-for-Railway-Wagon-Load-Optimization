# Cost Effective Freight Management with IoT Integration for Railway Wagon Load Optimization
## Overview
- The internet of things (IoT) is connecting the devices and tools to the internet network to be controlled by **websites and smart phone applications** remotely, also, to control tools and instruments by codes and algorithms structures for **artificial intelligence issues**. 
- In case we want to create advanced systems using Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection is connected to our tools, equipment, and devices controlling them by smart phone applications or internet websites. Thatâ€™s actually the simplified definition of IoT. Improving the efficacy and economy of freight management in railroad logistics is the goal of the project **"Cost-effective Freight Management with IoT Integration for Railway Wagon Load Optimization."**
- The project aims to enhance railway wagon loading to increase freight capacity while lowering operating expenses through the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The system has the ability to **track inventory, modify load distribution dynamically, and optimize logistical procedures by means of real-time monitoring and data analysis**. The project's ultimate goals are to increase overall efficiency in **railway freight operations, utilize resources more efficiently, and save transportation expenses.**
- Both the **cargo and the railroad** infrastructure may be seriously endangered by railroad wagons that are either overloaded or underloaded.
- Overloading can result in **accidents, derailments, and track damage**; underloading can create instability while in transit.
